# Homework 2 - CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Description

The Password Generator Assignment was to create a website that generated a password with a choice of up to 4 character types - numerical values, lowercase, uppercase, special characters - and a length between 8 and 128. The user inputs their desired attributes, and a password is randomly generated.

To complete this assignment, I knew to use a generate a charset of the desired attributes, and then use a random function to pick characters in the charset to create a string of the requested length.

This was a straightforward assignment, but this is one of the assignments, I plan to revisit to update and make for user-friendly by adding a form instead of alerts and prompts, for example.
