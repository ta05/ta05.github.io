# Homework 5 - Third Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The Work Day Scheduler Assignment was to create a website where the user is presented with a daily planner interface. The planner is segmented into hour blocks and color-coded for past, present and future hours. The events will have been saved and displayed.

When the user opens up the website
Then the user is presented with a daily schedule interface with today's date.
When the user clicks on a timeblock
Then the interface allows keyboard inputs from the user.
When the user clicks the save button
Then the user's input is saved.
When the user refreshes the page
Then all the user's saved inputs will be displayed.

## Results

I was able to get complete all the functionality requests. I broke down the entire assignment into smaller tasks which helped me to figure out what needed to be done for each task. This in turn, made my code more organized and my thought process more linear. It also better helped me connect each of the small tasks that we did to activities we did in class (ex: calculator button values -> save button values). Very confident with jQuery.
