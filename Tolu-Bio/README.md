# Homework 2 - CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Description

The Responsive Portfolio Assignment was to create my portfolio website with three webpages - an about me, my work, and a contact page. The website was to be mobile responsive, and we were to use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create it.

To complete this assignment, I started with the index html (about me page), and created the containers with rows and columns. I added a navbar from bootstrap, and created a style sheet with my own changes.

I used this same framework for the contact page and portfolio page as well, but created a separate style sheet for the portfolio.

I improved on getting comfortable working with containers, rows and columns in bootstrap, particularly col-xx-#. But, I still had difficulty getting the container to adjust to smaller screen sizes and getting the margins correct.
