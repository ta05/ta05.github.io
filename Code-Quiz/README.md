# Homework 4 - Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

The Code Quiz Assignment was to create a quiz on javascript where the user was scored by the remaining time upon completion of the quiz.
Points were docked for incorrect responses.

When the user opens the html file
Then they are prompted to start the quiz.
When the user starts the quiz
Then the first question and timer are displayed.
When the user answers a question
Then the next question, the result of the previous question and the new time remaining are displayed.
When the user answers the final question
Then their final score and a text area for submit their score is displayed.
When the user submits their score
Then they are displayed the scores in the local storage.

## Results
The assignment helped me to actually put into practice DOM manipulation, event listeners and web APIs.
It also helped me to improve organizing to increase readability. I generally jump around when I'm working on a problem, but as I placed my blocks of code into functions, I made a concerted effort to make the code make sense to an outside party.
