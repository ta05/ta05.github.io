# Homework 1 - Horiseon Refactor Assignment

## Description 

The Horiseon Refactor Assignment was to take the existing Horiseon homepage and refactor the HTML into semantic HTML. The file includes the refactored html file, the css file and the related images.

To complete this assignment, I went through the original HTML, updated the div tags to specify if that body of html was a header, section, aside or footer. I also added alt tags to describe images used to make the website more accessible. Lastly I made some other quality changes like updating the title of the website, making the Horiseon logo clickable that re-directs back to this page and some other minor changes.

I also took the liberty to make small styling changes to the CSS file. I changed the Benefits box to be even with the content section, and centered the text describing the benefits.

I learned what it means to make an html file's elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
