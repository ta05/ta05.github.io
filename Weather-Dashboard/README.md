# Homework 6 - Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Work Day Scheduler Assignment was to create a website where the user is weather dashboard interface using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The user is able to search for cities, and the site updates with current conditions and a 5-day forecast

When the user opens up the website
Then the user is presented with the current weather, temperature, wind speed, humidity and UV index in the default city. The user is also presented with forecasts for the next 5 days.
When the user searches for a city
Then the weather data is updated for the searched city, and a button of the city appears on the dashboard. The searched value is saved in the local storage.
When the user clicks on a button of a city
Then the weather data is updated for the clicked city.
When the user refreshes the page
Then the most recent searched city's weather data is displayed.

## Results

I completed all the functionality of the site. I attempted to retrieve the user's current location to default displaying the weather conditions for their current location. I was unable to get this feature to work, so I used Houston as the default city.
